My name is Yihan Wu. I am a forth-year Ph.D. student in the [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/index.htm), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/). My advisor is Prof. [Ruihua Song](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/rsong). Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I earned my B.S. degree from Shandong University in 2021.
I am broadly interested in speech related researches, including speech synthesis, speech recognition, and speech language models.
